# CAPTCHA Handling in AI Playwright Scripter

## Overview

The AI Playwright Scripter now includes automatic CAPTCHA detection and handling capabilities. When a CAPTCHA is detected during automation, the system will pause and prompt for manual intervention.

## How It Works

### 1. Detection
The Vision API analyzes failed actions and checks for:
- reCAPTCHA
- hCaptcha
- Other challenge-response tests

### 2. User Notification
When a CAPTCHA is detected:
- The automation pauses
- A screenshot is taken and saved
- The user is prompted in the console
- The browser window remains open for manual solving

### 3. Manual Intervention
1. Look at the browser window
2. Solve the CAPTCHA manually
3. Press ENTER in the console to continue
4. The automation resumes after a brief wait

## Anti-Detection Features

To reduce CAPTCHA triggers, the browser is configured with:
- Realistic user agent strings
- Disabled automation indicators
- Natural geolocation and timezone
- Browser fingerprint masking

## Example Output

```
⚠️  CAPTCHA DETECTED!
Type: recaptcha
Screenshot saved to: screenshots/captcha_3_2025-07-20T06-15-30-123Z.png

Please solve the captcha manually in the browser window.
Press ENTER when you have solved the captcha...
```

## Tips for Avoiding CAPTCHAs

1. **Add delays between actions**: The automation already includes wait steps
2. **Use residential proxies**: For production use, consider proxy rotation
3. **Vary your patterns**: Don't run the same automation repeatedly
4. **Run with headed browser**: Use `--headed` flag to appear more human-like

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with CAPTCHA solving services (2captcha, Anti-Captcha)
- Machine learning-based CAPTCHA detection
- Automatic retry strategies for different CAPTCHA types
