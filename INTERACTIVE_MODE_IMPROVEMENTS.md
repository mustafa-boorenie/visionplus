# Interactive Mode Improvements

## Overview

The interactive mode has been significantly enhanced to provide a more intelligent and user-friendly automation experience. When you start an interactive session, it now collects important context upfront and uses this information throughout the session.

## New Features

### 1. Session Setup

When starting interactive mode (`npm run ai interactive`), you'll be prompted for:

- **Starting URL**: The initial website to navigate to
- **Credentials**: Username, password, and any additional login fields
- **Arguments**: Dynamic data like patient names, DOB, provider info, etc.

### 2. Smart Command Enhancement

Commands are automatically enhanced with your session context:

- Login commands automatically use provided credentials
- Placeholders in commands (e.g., `{patientName}`) are replaced with actual values
- Context-aware execution improves success rates

### 3. Success Confirmation

After each command execution:
- You're asked to confirm if the action completed successfully
- Failed commands are automatically removed from the session
- Generated test files for failed commands are deleted
- Only successful commands are saved in sequences

### 4. Enhanced Session Status

The `status` command now shows:
- Current browser state
- Session context (URL, credentials, arguments)
- Command history with success/failure indicators
- Ready-to-save successful commands

### 5. Context-Aware Sequence Saving

When saving sequences:
- Session context is embedded in the sequence description
- Only successful commands are included
- Failed commands are automatically filtered out

## Example Usage

```bash
$ npm run ai interactive

ðŸ“‹ Session Setup

Starting URL (press Enter to skip): https://portal.example.com
Do you need to provide credentials? (y/n): y
Username: john.doe
Password: ****
Any additional credential fields? (comma-separated names, or press Enter to skip): 
Do you need to provide any data/arguments (e.g., patient name, DOB, etc.)? (y/n): y
Enter argument names (comma-separated, e.g., "patientName,DOB,provider"): patientName,DOB
patientName: John Smith
DOB: 01/15/1980

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Errors**: Context-aware execution improves accuracy
2. **Cleaner Sequences**: Only successful commands are saved
3. **Better Organization**: Session context is preserved with sequences
4. **Improved UX**: Clear feedback and automatic cleanup
5. **Reusability**: Saved sequences include all necessary context

## Technical Details

### Session Context Structure

```typescript
interface SessionContext {
  startUrl?: string;
  credentials?: {
    username?: string;
    password?: string;
    [key: string]: string | undefined;
  };
  arguments?: {
    [key: string]: string;
  };
}
```

### Command Enhancement

- Credentials are automatically injected into login-related commands
- Placeholders like `{variableName}` or `${variableName}` are replaced
- Context is included in saved sequence metadata

### Failure Handling

- Failed commands trigger cleanup automatically
- Generated test files are deleted
- Session history excludes failed attempts
- User receives helpful feedback for retry
